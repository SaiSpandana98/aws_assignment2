Question 1:

step 1- Launching an EC2 instance in n.verginia #chosen Amazon Linux AMI
        #The security group must include inbound rules for SSH and HTTP access

step 2- connect to instance and install web server
      $ sudo yum update -y

#install the Apache web server with the PHP software package using the yum install command

      $ sudo yum install -y httpd24 php56 php56-mysqlnd

#Start the web server with the command shown following

      $ sudo service httpd start

#Configure the web server to start with each system boot using the chkconfig command

      $ sudo chkconfig httpd on

#you add a group named www to your EC2 instance, and then you give that group ownership of the /var/www directory and add write permissions for the group

      $ sudo groupadd www
      $ sudo usermod -a -G www ec2-user
      $ exit

#verify that the www group exists with the groups command

      $ groups
      ec2-user wheel www

#Change the group ownership of the /var/www directory and its contents to the www group

      $ sudo chown -R root:www /var/www

#Change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to add group write permissions and set the group ID on subdirectories created in the future

      $ sudo chmod 2775 /var/www
      $ find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} +

#Recursively change the permissions for files in the /var/www directory and its subdirectories to add group write permissions

      $ find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} +

#change the directory to /var/www and create a new subdirectory named inc

      $ cd /var/www/html
      $ mkdir inc

#in inc folder writing html content into created index.html file

      $ cd inc
      $ echo "<html><h1>Hello from Spandana</h1></html>" > index.html

#browsing to http://EC2 instance endpoint/index.html
    
  $ http://EC2 instance public DNS Name/inc/index.html

Step 3: Created an AMI of this instance.

Step 4 : Meanwhile a classic loadbalancer is created
         
Step 5 : actual instance is terminated, created launch configuration for our AMI

Step 6 : Next created autoscaling grp to the launch configuration, with a VPC and 2 subnets in different zones

         for a classic load balancer target group is not required 

Step 7 : Using scaling grp, instance would be launched automatically

Step 8 : DNS name of the instance is copied and added the index.html file path to it. We would find index.html file

The listner configuration would be HTTP port, TCP protocol, 0.0.0.0/0 source
