Step 1 : create two EC2 instances

Step 2 : Each of those instances are connected to SSH separately through MobaXterm using private key 

Step 3 : Consider one instance as the 'source' and the other as 'destination'

Step 4 : On the source instance run the following command

          ssh-keygen –t rsa

Step 5 : Public key would be saved as id_rsa.pub and private key would be saved as id_rsa

Step 6 : directed to .ssh/ folder in source instance

         cd .ssh/

Step 7 : view the content in id_rsa.pub which is located in .ssh/

         cat id_rsa.pub

Step 8 : directed to .ssh folder in 'destination' instance

         cd .shh

Step 9 : Opened 'authorized_keys' file in '.ssh'

         vi authorized_keys

Step 10 : The content in this file is replaced by the content of 'id_rsa.pub' file 

Step 11 : The permissions for .ssh folder destination instance has to be set to 700(rwx------) and authorized_keys file is set to 600(rw-------) permissions 
          for the SSH connection to work

         chmod 700 .ssh/
         chmod 600 authorized_keys

Step 12 : After correcting the permissions, gone to 'source instance' and typed the followed command

        ssh destination_instance_DNS_name

Step 13 : We would see that we got logged into destination instance through source instance
